Hello, I am an open source developer. In the past I was an avid C++ programmer, but nowadays I like to code most of my stuff using Nelua, C or Lua programming languages. Through my career I've created successful game engines, games, websites and development tools. But today I am mostly focusing on developing [Nelua](https://nelua.io/) programming language, things around it and some other Lua/C related stuff.

These are some open source projects, that may be useful for others and I'm actively maintaining today:

Nelua:
* [nelua](https://github.com/edubart/nelua-lang) - Low level systems programming languages inspired by Lua (to use in my future projects instead of C++).
* [nelua-decl](https://github.com/edubart/nelua-decl) - C bindings generator for Nelua (to use existing C libraries with Nelua).
* [nelua-sublime](https://github.com/edubart/nelua-sublime) - Sublime syntax for the Nelua programming language.
* [nldoc](https://github.com/edubart/nldoc) - Tool to generate documentation for Nelua source files.

Tools:
* [luamon](https://github.com/edubart/luamon) - Watch for file changes and autor restart an application (for quick live development).
* [forkmon](https://github.com/edubart/forkmon) - Watch for file changes and auto restart an application from a checkpoint (for quick live development).

C libraries:
* [minicoro](https://github.com/edubart/minicoro) - Cross-platform coroutine library in a single C header, inspired by Lua coroutines.
* [miniphysfs](https://github.com/edubart/miniphysfs) - PhysFS ported to a single C header, used to access files and archives.
* [minilua](https://github.com/edubart/minilua) - Lua programming language ported to a single C header.
* [minivorbis](https://github.com/edubart/minivorbis) - Ogg Vorbis library ported to a single C header.
* [miniminiz](https://github.com/edubart/miniminiz) - Miniz, a high performance data compression library, ported to a single C header.

Lua libraries:
* [lpegrex](https://github.com/edubart/lpegrex) - Parse programming languages syntax into an AST using PEGs with ease (LPeg Extension).
* [lester](https://github.com/edubart/lester) - Minimal testing framework for Lua.
* [lua-bint](https://github.com/edubart/lua-bint) - Arbitrary precision integer arithmetic library in pure Lua.

There are some other projects I made in the past, that I don't maintain anymore but it's worth noting:
* [otclient](https://github.com/edubart/otclient) - Client for MMORPG games, today it's used in the wild by multiple successful commercial games (most in private though).
* [euluna-binder](https://github.com/edubart/euluna-binder) - Smart Lua binder for C++ (extracted from otclient, simplified and made in standalone).
* [otml](https://github.com/edubart/otml) - OTML file format (extract from otclient and made in standalone).
* [synack](https://github.com/edubart/synack) - Tool to stress dedicated servers with network DDoS attacks with high throughput.
* [ddosmon](https://github.com/edubart/ddosmon) - Tool to monitor network DDoS attacks.
